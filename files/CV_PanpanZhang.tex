\section{Research}
My current research focuses on developing novel statistical methods 
for missing data and longitudinal data, which are primarily 
motivated by neurodegenerative disease data. Besides, I have 
interest and experience in random networks and graphs, probabilistic 
graphical models, scalable algorithms, Bayesian
analysis, and network data inference. I also have research 
experience in scan statistics, multivariate clustering analysis, 
combinatorial probabilities, asymptotic approximations, and 
analytical techniques for the analysis of algorithms and data 
structure.
