excerpt: 'In this paper, we uncover the structures of random lobster and spider trees. Specifically, we consider the random lobster trees that
grow in two different manners. For random spider trees, we characterize the asymptotic distriubtion of the number of leaves as well as two kinds
of topological indices.'

In this paper, we investigate several random structures, namely two classes of random lobster trees (RLTs) and a class of random spider trees (RSTs). 
The first class of RLTs grow with a fixed probability, whereas those from the second class evolve in a dynamic manner underlying a flavor of 
semi-opposite reinforcement. For these two classes, we characterize the structure of the random graphs therein via some probabilistic methods. 
In addition, we look into a class of RSTs that evolve in a preferential attachment manner. We characterize the structure of RSTs by determining 
the exact and asymptotic distributions of the number of leaves, and by computing two kinds of topological indices.'
