excerpt: 'In this paper, we studied a general class of poissonized (tenable and balanced) urns. We characterized the asymptotic behavior 
of the processes by solving a partial differential equation governing the processes. We also conducted an analogous analysis of a class 
of processes associated with randomized replacement matrix.'

We propose an elementary but effective approach to studying a general class of Poissonized tenable and balanced urns on two colors. 
We characterize the asymptotic behavior of the process via a partial differential equation that governs the process, coupled with the 
method of moments applied in a bootstrapped manner. We show that the limiting distribution of the process underlying the Bagchi-Pal urn 
is gamma. We also look into the tenable and balanced processes associated with randomized replacement matrix. Similar results carry over 
to the process, with minor modifications in the methods of proof, done mutatis mutandis.
