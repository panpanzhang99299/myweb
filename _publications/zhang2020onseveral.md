excerpt: 'In this paper, we looked into investigated the degree profile of plane-oriented recursive trees (PORTs), a class of random trees presenting the feature of preferential attachment (PA). Besides, we studied the Zagreb index of the PORTs, by computing the first two moments. Lastly, we degree distribution of the PORTs growing in continuous time where a poissonization-based embedding was adapted.'
