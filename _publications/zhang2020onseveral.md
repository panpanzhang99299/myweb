excerpt: 'In this paper, we look into the degree profile of plane-oriented recursive trees (PORTs), 
a class of random trees presenting the feature of preferential attachment (PA). Besides, we study the Zagreb index of the PORTs, 
by computing the first two moments. Lastly, we determine degree distribution of the PORTs growing in continuous time where 
a poissonization-based embedding has been adapted.'

In this paper, several properties of a class of trees presenting preferential attachment phenomenon—plane-oriented recursive trees (PORTs) 
are uncovered. Specifically, we investigate the degree profile of a PORT by determining the exact probability mass function of the degree of 
a node with a fixed label. We compute the expectation and the variance of degree variable via a Pólya urn approach. In addition, we study a 
topological index, Zagreb index, of this class of trees. We calculate the exact first two moments of the Zagreb index (of PORTs) by using 
recurrence methods. Lastly, we determine the limiting degree distribution in PORTs that grow in continuous time, where the embedding is 
done in a Poissonization framework. We show that it is exponential after proper scaling.
