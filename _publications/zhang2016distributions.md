excerpt: 'In this paper, we studied a class of PÃ³lya processes underlying terminal nodes in a random Apollonian network (RAN). The first two moments were computed exactly by solving a set of ordinary differential equations. Additionaly, we exploited classical methods of branching processes to derive the asymptotic results.'
