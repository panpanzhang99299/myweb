excerpt: 'TAR-DNA binding protein-43 (TDP-43) proteinopathy has been seen in multiple brain diseases. 
In this paper, we combine both cases and neuropathologistsâ€™ diagnoses from two research centres---University of Pennsylvania and 
University of Kentucky. The study is designed to compare neuropathological findings between frontotemporal lobar 
degeneration with TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP) and limbic-predominant, age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE).'
