In this article, we investigate several properties of high-dimensional random Apollonian networks, including two types of degree profiles, 
the small-world effect (clustering property), sparsity and three distance-based metrics. The characterizations of the degree profiles are 
based on several rigorous mathematical and probabilistic methods, such as a two-dimensional mathematical induction, 
analytic combinatorics and Pólya urns, etc. The small-world property is uncovered by a well-developed measure—local clustering coefficient 
and the sparsity is assessed by a proposed Gini index. Finally, we look into three distance-based properties; they are total depth, diameter 
and Wiener index.
