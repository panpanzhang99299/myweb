collection: publications
permalink: /publication/gao2024characterizing
excerpt: 'In this paper, we analyze DTI data from 1035 subjects in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, with ages ranging from 22.4 to 
103 years old. We assessed the variance of DTI scalars within regions of interest (ROIs) defined by four segmentation methods and investigated
the relationships between the variance and covariates, including baseline age, time from the baseline, motion and sex, among others. 
This work has provided a foundation for study planning to account for regional variations in metric variance.

A network-based method applied to collaborative filtering in recommender systems is introduced in this paper. Specifically, a novel mixed-membership 
stochastic block model with a conjugate prior from the exponential family is proposed for bipartite networks. The analytical expression of the model 
is derived, and a variational Bayesian algorithm that is computationally feasible for approximating the untractable posterior distributions is presented. 
Extensive simulations show that the proposed model provides more accurate inference than competing methods with the presence of outliers. The proposed 
model is also applied to a MovieLens dataset for a real data application.
