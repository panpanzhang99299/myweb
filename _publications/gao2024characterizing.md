title: "Characterizing patterns of diffusion tensor imaging variance in aging brains"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/gao2024characterizing
excerpt: 'In this paper, we analyze DTI data from 1035 subjects in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, with ages ranging from 22.4 to 
103 years old. We assessed the variance of DTI scalars within regions of interest (ROIs) defined by four segmentation methods and investigated
the relationships between the variance and covariates, including baseline age, time from the baseline (referred to as "interval"), motion and sex, 
among others. This work has provided a foundation for study planning to account for regional variations in metric variance.
