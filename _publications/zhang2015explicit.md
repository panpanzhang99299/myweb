collection: publications
permalink: /publication/zhang2015explicit
excerpt: 'In this paper, we proposed an elementary approach to studying two-color urn model. The dynamic of the urns was characterized via the moments. The exact moments include Stirling numbers of the second second kind. The asymptoic moments were derived as well.'
