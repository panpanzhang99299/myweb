permalink: /publication/zhang2016onterminal
excerpt: 'In this paper, we investigated terminal nodes and the degree profile in preferential dynamic attachment circuits. We showed that the number of terminal nodes followed a Gaussian law asymptotically. A generalized PÃ³lya urn model was used to study the exact distribution of the degree of a specific node in the circuit.'
