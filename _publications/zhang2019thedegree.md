excerpt: 'In this paper, we investigated the degree profile and the Gini index of two classes of random caterpillars evolving in different manners: uniform and preferential attachment (PA). The primariy method used in the analysis included stochastic recurrences, generalized PÃ³lya urns and some combinatorial computing techniques.'
