excerpt: 'In this paper, we propose a class of assortativity measures for weighted, directed networks. Through simulation studies and applications to World
Input-Output Tables, we find that the proposed measures outperform the classical counterparts without accounting for edge weights and directions. The implementation

Assortativity measures the tendency of a vertex in a network being connected by other vertexes with respect to some vertex-specific features. 
Classical assortativity coefficients are defined for unweighted and undirected networks with respect to vertex degree. 
We propose a class of assortativity coefficients that capture the assortative characteristics and structure of weighted and directed networks more precisely. 
The vertex-to-vertex strength correlation is used as an example, but the proposed measure can be applied to any pair of vertex-specific features. 
The effectiveness of the proposed measure is assessed through extensive simulations based on prevalent random network models in comparison with existing 
assortativity measures. In application to World Input-Ouput Networks, the new measures reveal interesting insights that would not be obtained by using 
existing ones. An implementation is publicly available in a R package <i>wdnet<i>.
