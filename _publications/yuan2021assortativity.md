permalink: /publication/yuan2021assortativity
excerpt: 'Assortativity measures the tendency of a vertex in a network being connected by other vertexes with respect to some vertex-specific features.  Classical 
	assortativity coefficients are defined for unweighted and undirected networks with respect to vertex degree. We	propose a class of assortativity coefficients that capture the 
	assortative characteristics and structure of weighted and directed networks more precisely. The vertex-to-vertex strength correlation is used
	as an example, but the proposed measure can be applied to any pair of vertex-specific features. The effectiveness of the proposed 
	measure is assessed through extensive simulations based on prevalent random network models in comparison with existing assortativity 
	measures. In application to World Input-Ouput Networks,	the new measures reveal interesting insights that would
	not be obtained by using existing ones. An implementation is publicly available in a <i>R<i> package <i>wdnet<i>.'
