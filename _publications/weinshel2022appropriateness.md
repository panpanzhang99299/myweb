collection: publications
permalink: /publication/weinshel2022appropriateness
excerpt: 'In this paper, we assessed the suitability and diagnostic accuracy of established cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker 
cutoffs for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the Parkinson's disease (PD) population. Specifically, we considered amyloid-ß 1-42 (Aß 1-42), 
total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau (p-tau), the ratio of t-tau and Aß 1-42 and the ratio of p-tau and Aß 1-42.'
