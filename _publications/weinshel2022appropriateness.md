excerpt: 'In this paper, we discussed the appropriateness of applying cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker cutoffs from Alzheimer’s 
disease (AD) to Parkinson's disease (PD), for which this stream of study has not been estensively investigated. Specifically, we looked
into the optimal cutoffs of Aβ142, t-tau, p-tau, t-tau/Aβ142 and p-tau/Aβ142, while PET amyloid imaging was used as the gold standard.
Based on the PPMI cohort (for PD), we concluded that the optimal cutoffs for Aβ142, t-tau/Aβ142, and p-tau/Aβ142 to predict amyloid-PET 
positivity and for t-tau and p-tau to predict cognitive impairment differed significantly from cutoffs derived from AD populations.'
