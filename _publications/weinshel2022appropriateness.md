excerpt: 'In this paper, we discussed the appropriateness of applying cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker cutoffs from Alzheimer’s 
disease (AD) to Parkinson's disease (PD), for which this stream of study has not been estensively investigated. Specifically, we looked
into the optimal cutoffs of Aβ142, t-tau, p-tau, t-tau/Aβ142 and p-tau/Aβ142, while PET amyloid imaging was used as the gold standard.
Based on the PPMI cohort (for PD), we concluded that the optimal cutoffs for Aβ142, t-tau/Aβ142, and p-tau/Aβ142 to predict amyloid-PET 
positivity and for t-tau and p-tau to predict cognitive impairment differed significantly from cutoffs derived from AD populations. '

Background: While cutoffs for abnormal levels of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers amyloid-β 1-42 (Aβ142), total tau (t-tau), 
phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and the ratios of t-tau/Aβ142 and p-tau/Aβ142, have been established in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), biologically 
relevant cutoffs have not been studied extensively in Parkinson’s disease (PD). 

Objective: Assess the suitability and diagnostic accuracy of established AD-derived CSF biomarker cutoffs in the PD population. 

Methods:Baseline and longitudinal data on CSF biomarkers, cognitive diagnoses, and PET amyloid imaging in 423 newly diagnosed patients with 
PD from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) cohort were used to evaluate established AD biomarker cutoffs compared with 
optimal cutoffs derived from the PPMI cohort. 

Results:Using PET amyloid imaging as the gold standard for AD pathology, the optimal cutoff of Aβ142 was higher than the AD cutoff, the 
optimal cutoffs of t-tau/Aβ142 and p-tau/Aβ142 were lower than the AD cutoffs, and their confidence intervals (CIs) did not overlap with 
the AD cutoffs. Optimal cutoffs for t-tau and p-tau to predict cognitive impairment were significantly lower than the AD cutoffs, and 
their CIs did not overlap with the AD cutoffs. 

Conclusion: Optimal cutoffs for the PPMI cohort for Aβ142, t-tau/Aβ142, and p-tau/Aβ142 to predict amyloid-PET positivity and for t-tau and 
p-tau to predict cognitive impairment differ significantly from cutoffs derived from AD populations. The presence of additional pathologies
such as alpha-synuclein in PD may lead to disease-specific CSF biomarker characteristics.
