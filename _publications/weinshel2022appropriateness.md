collection: publications
permalink: /publication/chen2019characterizations
excerpt: 'In this paper, we study a general class of poissonized (tenable and balanced) urns. 
We characterize the asymptotic behavior of the processes by solving a partial differential equation governing the processes. 
We also conduct an analogous analysis of a class of processes associated with randomized replacement matrix.'
