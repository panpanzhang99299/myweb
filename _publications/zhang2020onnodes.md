title: "On nodes of small degrees and degree profile in preferential dynamic attachment circuits"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/zhang2020onnodes
excerpt: 'In this paper, we investigated two properties of class of preferential attachment (PA) networks evolving in a dynamic manner: the joint distribution of nodes of small degrees and the degree profile. The primary methods for the analysis included martingale theory, PÃ³lya urns and stochastic recurrences.'
