There is an unproven duality theory hypothesizing that random discrete trees and their poissonized embeddings in continuous time share fundamental properties. 
We give additional evidence in favor of this theory by showing that several classes of random trees growing in discrete time and
their poissonized counterparts have the same limiting degree Gini index. The classes that we consider include binary search trees, binary pyramids and
random caterpillars.
