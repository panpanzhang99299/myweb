excerpt: 'In this paper, we studied a class of unbalanced constant-differentials Pólya processes on two colors. We showed that the asymptotic distribution of the variable of interest depned on the diferential index, but not on the initial conditions. The result was obtained by an analytic approach utilizing partial differential equations.'
