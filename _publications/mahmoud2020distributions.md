excerpt: 'In this paper, we proposed an elementary approach to studying two-color urn model. The dynamic of the urns was characterized via the moments. The exact moments include Stirling numbers of the second second kind. The asymptoic moments were derived as well.'

We study a class of unbalanced constant-differentials Pólya processes on white and blue balls. We show that the number of white balls, the number of blue balls, and the total number of balls, when appropriately scaled, all converge in distribution to gamma random variables with parameters depending on the differential index and the amount of ball addition at the epochs, but not on the initial conditions. The result is obtained by an analytic approach utilizing partial differential equations. We present a martingale formulation that may provide alternatives
