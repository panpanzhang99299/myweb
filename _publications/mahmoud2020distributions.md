excerpt: 'In this paper, we study a class of unbalanced constant-differentials P贸lya processes on two colors. 
We show that the asymptotic distribution of the variable of interest depned on the diferential index, but not on the initial conditions. 
The result is obtained by an analytic approach utilizing partial differential equations.'

We study a class of unbalanced constant-differentials P贸lya processes on white and blue balls. 
We show that the number of white balls, the number of blue balls, and the total number of balls, 
when appropriately scaled, all converge in distribution to gamma random variables with parameters depending on the differential index 
and the amount of ball addition at the epochs, but not on the initial conditions. 
The result is obtained by an analytic approach utilizing partial differential equations. 
We present a martingale formulation that may provide alternatives.
