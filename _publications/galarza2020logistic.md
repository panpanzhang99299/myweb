collection: publications
permalink: /publication/galarza2020logistic
excerpt: 'In this paper, we proposed a robust logistic quantile regression (QR) model by using a logit link function along an EM-based algorithm. The QR model was built on a generalized class of skewed distributions. The proposed method was compared with a nonparametric competing alternative.'
