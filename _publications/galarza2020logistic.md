excerpt: 'In this paper, we studied a general class of poissonized (tenable and balanced) urns. We characterized the asymptotic behavior of the processes by solving a partial differential equation governing the processes. We also conducted an analogous analysis of a class of processes associated with randomized replacement matrix.'
