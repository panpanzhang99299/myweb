excerpt: 'In this paper, we consider a directed hybrid random network that mixes preferential attahcment (PA) rules with
uniform attachment (UA) rules. We rigorously show that this class of networks have lighter distributional tails than pure
PA models. For inference, two parameter estimation schemes are developed, and justified by simulations. A real network
data application indicates that the proposed network model provides a better fit than pure PA model.'

Motivated by the complexity of network data, we propose a directed hybrid random network that mixes 
preferential attachment (PA) rules with uniform attachment rules. When a new edge is created, with probability 
pâˆˆ(0,1), it follows the PA rule. Otherwise, this new edge is added between two uniformly chosen nodes. 
Such mixture makes the in- and out-degrees of a fixed node grow at a slower rate, compared to the pure PA case, 
thus leading to lighter distributional tails. For estimation and inference, we develop two numerical methods which 
are applied to both synthetic and real network data. We see that with extra flexibility given by the parameter p, 
the hybrid random network provides a better fit to real-world scenarios, where lighter tails from in- and out-degrees 
are observed.
