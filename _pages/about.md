Welcome to Panpan Zhang's personal website. I am currently an Assistant Professor (tenure track) in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.vumc.org/biostatistics/vanderbilt-department-biostatistics) at the [Vanderbilt University Medical Center](https://www.vumc.org/main/home) (VUMC). Besides, I am a faculty member within the [Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimer's Center](https://www.vumc.org/vmac/home) (VMAC), which is also affiliated to VUMC.  

Prior to joining VUMC, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/) (DBEI) at the [Perelman School of Medicine](https://www.med.upenn.edu/), [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/) (Penn), under the supervision of Professor [Sharon X. Xie](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/bio/sharon-xiangwen-xie-phd). From 2016 to 2018, I was a Visiting Assistant Professor in the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.uconn.edu/) at the [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu/).

My biography
============

I grew up in Shanghai, China.

I got Ph.D. in Statistics in 2016. My dissertation was [On Properties of Several Random Networks](https://search-proquest-com.proxy.library.upenn.edu/docview/1778511395/fulltextPDF/85F5580422DB4BC5PQ/1?accountid=14707) under the supervision of Professor [Hosam M.
