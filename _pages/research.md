My research interest lies at the interface of applied probability, applied statistics and machine learning. My research is driven by collaborations with a few extremely talented and outstanding researchers.

Network analysis
====================
This is a broad and burgeoning research topic. Specifically, I am interested in
* Random network models (**collaborator:** [Hosam M. Mahmoud](https://statistics.columbian.gwu.edu/hosam-m-mahmoud), [Tiandong Wang](https://sites.google.com/tamu.edu/twang));
* Network inference (**collaborator:** [Jun Yan](http://merlot.stat.uconn.edu/~jyan/));
* Community detection (**collaborator:** [Dipak K. Dey](http://merlot.stat.uconn.edu/~dey/)).
