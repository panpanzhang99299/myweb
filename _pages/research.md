My research interest lies at the interface of applied probability, applied statistics and machine learning. My research is driven by collaborations with a few extremely talented and outstanding researchers.

Network analysis
====================
This is a broad and burgeoning research topic. Specifically, I am interested in
* Random network models (**collaborator(s):** [Hosam M. Mahmoud](https://statistics.columbian.gwu.edu/hosam-m-mahmoud), [Tiandong Wang](https://sites.google.com/tamu.edu/twang));
* Network inference (**collaborator(s):** [Jun Yan](http://merlot.stat.uconn.edu/~jyan/));
* Community detection (**collaborator(s):** [Dipak K. Dey](http://merlot.stat.uconn.edu/~dey/)).

Longitudinal analysis
====================
This is the primary focus of my postdoctoral training. We are committed to developing novel statistical methods for assessing dementia risk in neurodegenerative diseases and related disorders. Specifically, we investigate missing data, measurement error and variable selection problems (**collaborator(s):** [Sharon X. Xie](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/bio/sharon-xiangwen-xie-phd)).

Bayesian statistics
====================
