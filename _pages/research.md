My research interest lies at the interface of applied probability, applied statistics and machine learning. My research is driven by collaborations with a few extremely talented and outstanding researchers.

Network analysis
====================
This is a broad and burgeoning research topic. Specifically, I am interested in
* Random network models (**collaborator(s):** [Hosam M. Mahmoud](https://statistics.columbian.gwu.edu/hosam-m-mahmoud), [Tiandong Wang](https://sites.google.com/tamu.edu/twang));
* Network inference (**collaborator(s):** [Jun Yan](http://merlot.stat.uconn.edu/~jyan/));
* Community detection (**collaborator(s):** [Dipak K. Dey](http://merlot.stat.uconn.edu/~dey/)).

Longitudinal data analysis
====================
This is the primary focus of my current reserch. We are committed to developing novel statistical methods for assessing dementia risk in neurodegenerative diseases and related disorders. Specifically, we investigate missing data, measurement error and variable selection problems, and focus on the applications to Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.  **Main collaborator(s):**
* [Dandan Liu](https://biostat.app.vumc.org/wiki/Main/DandanLiu)
* [Sharon X. Xie](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/bio/sharon-xiangwen-xie-phd).

Collaborative research
====================
I have engaged in a variety of research projects, in collaboration with the faculty members and medical professionals from
* Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimer's Center ([VMAC](https://www.vumc.org/vmac/home))
* Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research ([CNDR](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cndr/))
* Penn Frontotemporal Degeneration Center ([Penn FTD Center](https://www.med.upenn.edu/ftd/))
* [Penn Memory Center](https://pennmemorycenter.org/)
